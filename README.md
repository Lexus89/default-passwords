# awesome-default-passwords

An awesome collection of default passwords for various devices and services.
Useful for system administrators and for demonstrating that default passwords
are not awesome and terrible for the security ecosystem.

### The List
If you just want a list of passwords, this repository **maintains a CSV list**
[here](passwords.csv).  If you're trying to quickly look up the password(s)
associated with a specific device or service, this is probably where you want
to start.  If what you're looking for isn't in the list, subit an issue.
